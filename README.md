# 2D Flow Matching – Practical Work

This repository contains the practical work for **2D Flow Matching**, focusing on flow-based generative models, conditional flow matching, and neural ODEs implemented in PyTorch.

## Repository Structure

- **`TP_flow_matching.ipynb`**  
  Main notebook for the practical session.  
  It contains theoretical explainations on conditional flow matching and 2D flow matching model to implement.


- **`pytorch_1D_example.py`**  
  A minimal **1D PyTorch example** illustrating how to define and train a neural network in PyTorch.


## Objectives

The goals of this practical work are to:
- Learn how to train neural networks and neural ODEs with PyTorch
- Understand flow-based generative models
- Explore Conditional Flow Matching (CFM)
- Understand the connection between flow matching and optimal transport
- Use optimal transport ideas to improve training and inference

## Requirements

Typical dependencies include:
- Python 3.8+
- PyTorch
- NumPy
- Matplotlib
- Jupyter Notebook
